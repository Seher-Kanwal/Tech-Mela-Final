# Description about Project Design:

We didn't start a MVC project. We started from a simple template than we are creating each MVC componet seperately to understand the working of MVC properply for this
we are creating different folders for different functions. For example:
- Model (from mapping data to data source)
- Controllers (for Css, for Form)
- Services (For getting data from Data source)
- View (for displaying data to the User)

## Model :

We create a model with some parameter of json property type to get and set values within the data source.

![model code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92606737/198924509-9226e465-e364-4128-88c5-513a77f60ab9.PNG)


and we know that our data source is in json. So we used JsonSeriliazer to convert our data into Json formate. For this purpose we just override a function 
**ToString()**

# Services:
We are write services in order to perform various task on our data. And than using all these services in controllers insteading of writting each function again and again. We are using the same services in the controller to perform operations just by creating the object of the service class.
#### Service in the project:
- jsonEventDetailsService
- CssService

### jsonEventDetailsService
This service perform different operation on data. The functions are defined in that services are given below:
#### getpath():
As our data is residing in our project directory. To perform operations on this data we need to have it's path. This Function actually gets the path of data file dynamically. It utillizing the  IWebHostEnvironment data type to get the root of the directory than by using the __combine function__ it's take the few arguments and than return the path of the data source.

### CssService
Here in our project, instead of passing the directly CSS file address. We are passing a link that leads to the CSS file in the layout file. So to read the Data from the CSS file we write a service that do this task efficiently. Whenever we need our CSS for use, instead of writting all code again we just create an obj of service than call it's getCSS function that return a string from the CSS file.
