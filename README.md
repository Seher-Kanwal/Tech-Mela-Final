# Description about Project Design:
We didn't start a MVC project. We started from a simple template than we are creating each MVC componet seperately to understand the working of MVC properply for this
we are creating different folders for different functions. For example:
- Controllers (for Css, for Form)
- Services (For getting data from Data source)
- View (for displaying data to the User)
